  <h1 id="about">About</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Le, and I'm a prospective web developer! <br>
      Before decided to dive into coding, I was working with middle-school aged students at a charter school in Oakland.
      Over the years, I got to work with many talented, kind students and co-workers,
       from whom I learnt the ways to become a more efficient, and mindful educator.<br>
      As we encourage the students to to look further than their daily work, to explore their strength, to be brave and try new things,
      .... I saw these kids try, fail, and pick themselves up and try again;
      saw them slowly getting past their fear and gaining more confidence every day; saw their newfound respect for the power of resilience and curiousity.
      <br>Inspired to reflect upon the relationship I have with my own education, here I am and ready to learn.
