    <h3>
    Name is Le.
    I have been working at a middle school for the last three years,
    both in the traditional classroom as well as the small group/individual environment.
    Besides the amazing people I worked with, my favorite part of my job was using visual aids to teach abstract concepts.
    Each student has a unique way of perceiving and processing information,
    planning and executing each lesson required me to be more flexible, creative, and mindful.
    Research, reflect and readjust. Undestanding the fundamental material as well as the connection between them was needed.


    It helps me undestand the fundamental material much more deeply.

    Likes math and art, decided web development is a practical way of combining the two.
